## Problem Statement
[[Back to top]](https://github.com/NateAgcaoili/Brain-Teaser#index)

- Dementia is a serious mental illness that is most common for people over the age of 65, but can also affect much younger people.
- Early signs of the disease begin when people are in their 50s, 40s, and in some cases - even 30s.
- The most powerful way to combat this illness is by exercising your mind.

## Challenges to Overcome
[[Back to top]](https://github.com/NateAgcaoili/Brain-Teaser#index)

- The main challenge that we face is packing a lot of functionality and features into the application while at the same time maintaining a UI that is intuitive and easy to use and understand for all types of users.
- Because Brain Teaser is geared towards the elderly community, it is important for the mental exercise to be the actual puzzles and games we developed, not figuring out how to navigate through the application.
- We plan on avoiding this conflict by thoroughly planning the layout beforehand and communicating with/getting feedback from target end users.
