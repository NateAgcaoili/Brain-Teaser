## Project Description
Dementia is a serious mental illness that is most common for people over the age of 65, but can also affect much younger people.  Early signs of the disease begin when people are in their 50s, 40s, and in some cases - even 30s.  One of the most powerful ways to combat this illness is by exercising your mind.

We plan on developing a desktop application using `JavaFX` that contains a series of games, puzzles and challenges that will help exercise the brain of elderly people and people with pre existing conditions.
 
We plan to have multiple games to help with memories and problem solving skills. There is small variety in each one of the games so it will be different every single time.

We plan to develop a system where the user is rewarded based on completing tasks such as logging in consecutive days in a row, scoring well on the minigames, completing daily challenges, etc. On top of that, when they complete a level, they will receive some sort of in-game currency to purchase cosmetic items from the store.

The main challenge that we will face is packing a lot of functionality and features into the application while at the same time maintaining a UI that is intuitive and easy to use and understand for all types of users.  
Because Brain Teaser is geared towards the elderly community, it is important for the mental exercise to be the actual puzzles and games, not figuring out how to navigate through the application.  We plan on avoiding this conflict by thoroughly planning the layout beforehand and communicating with and getting feedback from target end users.
